"# this collection contains Applied Generative AI, LLMs and RNN-associated projects

* Built RNNs that can generate sequences based on input data - with a focus on two applications:
*  The first one uses real market data in order to predict future Apple stock prices using an RNN model.
* The second one will be trained on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic novel Sherlock Holmes and generates wacky sentences based on it that may - or may not - become the next great Sherlock Holmes novel.
